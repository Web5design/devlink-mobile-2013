    <h1>Chuck Catron</h1>
    <div style='background-position: -720px -80px;' class='speaker-image speaker-bio-image'></div><p>I am a software developer that got started in computers in 1996. Before that I was in the U.S. Navy for 6 years after high school.</p><p>When I started in computers I was programming in Pick Basic and it was crap. Then I converted to Microsoft using VB 5, then of course I moved on to VB 6. I got a great break in 2002 when I talked someone into letting me be their freelance web developer in ASP.Net 1.1 and C#. I didn't have a clue what I was doing, but they didn't know and I didn't bill them for at least half the hours. I got ramped up pretty quick mainly because I quit sleeping and was really working my butt off.</p><p>Now I have been doing C# and Asp webforms/MVC for the last 11 years and I love it. I have done the backend work building libs to get and save my data and that work is ok? I really like the UI stuff. I have been learning jQuery like a mofo. I am also digging the Backbone stuff not for the whole thing but really how it organizes my jQuery and makes it really easy to figure out.</p>
