            <p>PowerShell provides a number of mechanisms for controlling script flow. Besides the standard conditional statements and looping structures, PowerShell provides additional statements that allow you to customize how scripts will behave.  First we'll explore how to manage looping constructs by using break and continue statements.  Then we'll see how to perform looping, branching, and expression matching by using the switch statement with wildcards and regular expressions.  We'll also pattern match whole files by using the file processing option (-file) along with the switch statement and regular expressions.  Finally, we'll explain what transactions are and how they modify the script behavior.</p>

            <p>AngularJS is a robust Javascript framework that moves beyond jQuery DOM manipulation and into an enterprise-level development mindset. It provides the right separation of concerns between the user interface and business functions by relying on dependency injection, services, and declarative markup. This session will focus on key benefits of developing with the AngularJS framework and walk-throughs of practical hands-on examples. This session will use ASP.NET MVC as the server technology, but since AngularJS is server agnostic the information presented will be useful regardless of the delivery mechanism.</p>

            <p><p>Douglas Crockford's book “Javascript: The Good Parts,” is one of the best selling JavaScript books of all time and is only 176 pages long. For most developers, there's an tacit belief that the rest of JavaScript falls under “bad,” especially when comparing that to the 900 pages of “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide” There are websites dedicated to these list of language mis-features and anti-patterns, and dozens of blog posts about how to avoid the “bad” in your own code.</p><p>I don't think that these most of these things are actually “bad”. In their day to day, developers don't need to worry about all of these smaller issues. Chances are, a JavaScript developer has encountered these difficult issues, learned the solution, and then immediately absorbed the concepts.</p><p>I'm going to explain to you, the real “bad” parts of the language. These are at least three JavaScript language features that are the most likely to trip up a JavaScript developer. Once you innately understand these issues, you will become significantly more productive in JavaScript, and will be a lot less confused when reading through large JavaScript code bases.</p></p>

Many web developers already have an understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript, but their knowledge is strictly confined to the browser.  WIth node.js, developers are exposed to a whole new world by introducing JavaScript as a first class language for server-side applications.  In this talk, we'll take a structured look at node.js from a .NET developers perspective.  We'll discuss what a .NET developer needs to know get started with node.js, and hopefully we'll expand your horizons!</p>

Unfortunately you might have found that organizing your application with jQuery can become difficult and you may experience code that feels more like a plate of spaghetti logic.</p><p>Thankfully several frameworks have been developed (Backbone.js and AngularJS) to help address these concerns and they provide a mechanism to loosely couple your components and encourage you to organize your code in a way that can increase maintainability.</p><p>In this session we will take a look at a tightly coupled jQuery application and slow convert it to both a Backbone.js application and an AngularJS application. During the conversion we will introduce the various components of each framework and discuss some pros and cons of each approach.</p><p>In addition to an overview of the two frameworks, we will cover some helpful resources that you can reference as you dive into them on your own.</p></p>

The draw of independence, self-reliance, flexibility and agility, growth and profit potential are all very appealing to right kind of individual.  Indeed being a freelance consultant or part of a small company can prove to be extraordinarily rewarding.</p><p>However, to quote Peter Parker, "with great power comes great responsibility."  If all you want to do is sit at a computer and write code all day, then professional independence is not for you.  You have to think about marketing and sales, accounting, billing, managing contractors or employees.  And not least of all, you must always be cognizant of the legal and tax implications of your actions and decisions.</p><p>This discussion is definitely NOT a replacement for seeking advice for your own qualified tax and legal advisors.  However, we will delve into some of the major issues facing owners of new small businesses.  This includes the choice of an appropriate business entity (e.g., sole proprietor, partnership, LLC); actual incorporation; asset protection for your business and your family; taxes (income and self-employment); and how to actually pay yourself.</p><p>If you are a small business owner -- or are seriously considering becoming one -- hopefully at the end of this session you will have a solid start to the questions that you need to ask yourself, and your accountant and lawyer, to make the best possible decisions for your situation.</p></p>

            <p>Resonsive Design. The concept of creating a web application that adapts and changes as the screen gets smaller. Go from a full web application right down to a mobile application without ever leaving the page. One application that will run everywhere. It sounds too good to be true. Twitter Bootstrap contains many of the tools that you need to get started creating rich web sites that scale to mobile. It gives you much of the JavaScript and CSS that you will need to make a truly responsive site. In this code heavy session, we'll build an app and explore the ins and outs of Twitter Bootstrap and it's responsive design capabilities. You will leave with the tools you need to start building responsive sites today.</p>

Maybe you're struggling with storing a lot of data, rapidly processing a huge volume of data, or maybe you're just curious. There are a bewildering array of options and use cases within the Hadoop ecosystem. Every day I help customers understand their data problems, understand where Hadoop fits into their environment, and determine how they can use Hadoop to solve their problem. This session provides an introduction to what Hadoop is, when it's appropriate to use Hadoop, and guidance on how to get started.</p>

            <p>Advanced functions allow PowerShell users to write functions that act like cmdlets, without having to compile the code written in C# or VB.NET. The difference between authoring a compiled cmdlet and an advanced function is that compiled cmdlets are .NET classes written in a .NET Framework language, whereas advanced functions are written in the PowerShell script language and borrow the native cmdlet functionality.  After creating our advanced functions, we'll wrap our library of functions and scripts into a module which can be easily shared with others and can be used to repackage third-party modules and to create custom self-contained solutions.</p>

            <p>What do you do if you have a production application issue that you can't recreate in a test environment? It used to be long nights in the test lab, frantically trying to fix the problem. No longer. In this session, you will see how to use Application Performance Management in System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1 to gather detailed production performance information, including exceptions and Performance Monitor data, for your web sites, web services, and Windows Services. When the data gathered does not fit within your applications' SLA, operations can digitally interact with development, creating a traceable conversation about what when wrong. Using technologies like IntelliTrace and Visual Studio 2012 with Team Foundation Server 2012, you'll see how developers can easily get to the root of an application problem and provide a fix all the while keeping Operations in the loop. In addition to seeing it work live, you will drill down into the technology and how it works, providing you with best practices for deployment and use in your own organization.</p>

            <p>Many people chose the field of Computer Science because they love playing computer games. But it can be difficult to write a game, requiring heavy graphics skills and perhaps knowledge of physics engines and such. And you typically have to learn many different skills and languages if you want to make your game available for Windows 8 and Android and iOS and Windows Phone. In this session, we have a solution for the time-constrained developer who still loves to make computer games. We will demonstrate tools like Scirra's Construct 2, which allow you to build games and export them to multiple platforms. You simply add backgrounds and sprites on a page, and use an "event sheet" of simple if-then statements to define your game logic.  There are also templates/tutorials to get you started creating a shooter game, physics puzzle, driving game, and platform game (like Super Mario Brothers).  You will leave able to get started building professional-looking cross-platform games.</p>

            <p>HTTP caching can reduce user wait time, decrease server load, and continue to serve content when an app server is down, but even the basics of cache-control headers are easy to misunderstand. In this talk, we will clarify the basics and then move on to explore specific applications of caching that can benefit web apps, including configuration of Varnish and delivery of precompiled assets from CloudFront.</p>

            <p>This session will start with a traditional ASP.NET web site and show step by step how to improve it for both client experience and scalability.  Review the basics of caching and learn how to avoid costly server round trips by using expirations to maximize use of the client's browser and also reduce server side execution time with data caching on the server.  Use HTTP compression, minification of JavaScript and CSS, and image optimization to reduce client downloads by 50-75%.  Take advantage of free CDN networks to host jQuery and Ajax files.  See how tools such as Fiddler and Google Page speed can be used to help diagnose and verify improvements.  Use jQuery to lazy load images only as they are about to be displayed.  Learn the techniques that can have the largest impact on web performance with the least amount of work.</p>

            <p>Many Windows Phone apps in the store are good, but they could be great if they understood the very basics of app Lifecycle management. App users should never know they left the app due to app behavior. We'll discuss and learn how to effectively and efficiently suspend, tombstone, resume and restore Windows Phone apps. Then we'll move on to teaching our apps how to respond to Voice Commands. Voice Commands are one of the most helpful features and yet one of the least leveraged features in the Windows Phone platform. We'll learn where they can help and how they can streamline the user experience.</p>

            <p><p>Open source tools.  We all use them. Whether it's an entire toolkit, a framework that meets some specific needs, or a simple custom control from NuGet, CodePlex, or CodeProject, it is hard to ignore the opportunity to improve our rate of development while learning new things from open source projects.</p><p>But what does “open source” truly mean?  Especially when working in a professional or corporate environment, what are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools. Often that depends upon the authors' own decisions regarding project licensing.</p><p>In this one-hour session, we will review a few of the core principals of open-source development and consumption, compare and contrast some of the more popular licenses in use today, and discuss both how to use the open source works of others and also how to properly license your own.</p></p>

            <p>CSS Scaffolding systems have some a long way since Blueprint and 960.gs. Bootstrap extends beyond the basic grid system to provide a beautiful and powerful design framework, and its power increases tenfold when combined with LESS, the dynamic stylesheet language. Spend a session learning about simple, reusable, variable-based CSS with LESS, and the beautiful, responsive designs that you can build off of it when combined with the Bootstrap framework. When you walk away from this session, you too will want to Bootstrap All the Things (with LESS).</p>

Using only a text editor and a browser, we'll start at the beginning by putting pixels on the page. We'll see that from there it's only a small jump to complex procedural drawings and animation.

            <p>JavaScript. Powerful, but dangerous. You can really blow your foot off if you're not careful, so a good suite of automated tests is critical for success. Jasmine is a framework that makes testing a joy. From its highly readable spec format to its built in spies and clock control, it's easy to get addicted. In this session we will quickly review why testing is so important when dealing with JavaScript, then we'll dive into Jasmine's features and integration into your automated build processes.</p>

            <p>Have you heard a lot of the buzz around JRuby and wondered "yeah, but why would I bother?" Have you looked at your production setup for your Ruby application and though "this really doesn't fit right for us"? If you answer yes to either, or both, of these then this talk is for you. In this session we will discuss why you might move to JRuby and Torquebox and what you get for making the move. We will walk through how to take a MRI based application that is currently in production with Nginx and Passenger to JRuby and Torquebox. We will also discuss the pros and cons as Chris shares the motivations, lessons learned, ups and downs of from having gone down this road twice as he attempts to answer both the why and how of using Torquebox to run your application.</p>
