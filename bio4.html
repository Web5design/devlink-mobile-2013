    <div style='background-position: -640px -320px;' class='speaker-image speaker-bio-image'></div>Jim Cowart is a web developer, tragically geeky about JavaScript, HTML5, open source, hybrid mobile development...but he's not a fan of lists, so we'll stop there. Having journeyed through Cold Fusion, an obscure proprietary JavaScript BI implementation, C#, a smidgeon of Erlang (&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3) and even spent some time as a data warehouse architect and developer (apparently he lied to us about not liking lists), he's most passionate about connecting with other developers â€“ learning, sharing and promoting patterns and ideas that will make development more productive, enjoyable and empowering. Jim lives in Chattanooga with his wife and two sons, and will be happy to make epic restaurant recommendations to any devLink attendees. He works for Telerik as a Developer Advocate for Icenium, and you can follow him on twitter - @ifandelse.
