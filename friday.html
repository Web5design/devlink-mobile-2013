              <p><p>In today's software world, the app is king.  And with apps becoming ever more essential to today's business, entertainment, and personal life, it almost goes without saying that any new development project or consumer product will eventually need to target multiple clients on multiple devices.  As a developer who may end up writing for the phone, tablet, web, and desktop, it can be critical to make the correct choices up front in terms of your team's development patterns and application architecture.</p><p>In this one-hour session, we will discuss some of the pitfalls faced by teams today.  Particularly for apps that are already in production, what limitations may there be to extending for the mobile and tablet world?  And if you are building from the ground up, what choices do you have to create a robust, flexible, accessible server and API that can be used by your own client app dev teams, as well as third-party API consumers who can extend your brand even further.</p><p>Our technical focus will largely remain agnostic to your chosen database technology, SQL (or NoSQL), and other back-end logic.  Instead, we will look at the services and client tiers.  The discussion will weigh the pros and cons of WCF Data Services (with JSON endpoints), as well as building RESTful services with the newer MVC 4 Web API.  Client-side technologies could be anything, but we will certainly consider at least clients for the web, iOS (via MonoTouch), and possibly XAML/WinJS for Windows 8.</p></p>

              <p>You're a PowerShell convert, and you live with a shell open now.  But you're finding yourself wishing that PowerShell handled something differently.  You know you could solve the problem with your .NET skills, but how do you tie the two technologies together?  Attend this session to learn how to write your own cmdlets and modules, from File > New Project, through dynamic types and testing, through deployment and sharing, and all the way to having your new cmdlets doing work for you.  We'll cover all of that in an hour, so we'll be moving quickly in this mostly-code session.  Come learn how to take your PowerShell skills to the next level by leveraging what you already know about .NET development and building a cmdlet to turn your SQL queries into pipeline-friendly objects.</p>

              <p>Why would you want to build both your wesbite and then repeat much of the same code to add on an API?  Using the open source ServiceStack.NET project you can easily build both a website and web services with a single set of code.  We will build a Razor based site that embed standards compliant web services that return any number of response formats including JSON, POX and SOAP. Even better, all of this runs on Mono so you can host your application on a number of different platforms. In addition we will review the ServiceStack.NET client that allows you to call the services with almost zero effort on any platform that supports .NET or Mono including Android and iPhone.</p>

              <p>How do you write large applications in JavaScript? Can it really be done? Like you would in any language, you break the large app into several small apps that communicate in a structured, predictable manner. Proper de-coupling is the key. In this session we'll cover the journey from spaghetti code, to introducing the observer pattern for first level events, and eventually introducing the concept of 'messaging' in JavaScript. We'll talk about the strengths and weakness of these approaches, some recommendations of when to use what, how powerful they can be in tandem...and have some fun looking at a completely ridiculous sample app utilizing messaging and events across frames and workers.</p>

They formed Xamarin roughly two years ago with a laser focus on the mobile space.</p><p>Xamarin is a really big for C# developers. There are several cross-platform frameworks based upon with web technologies, but this is the first mobile development product aimed squarely at C# developers. Beyond that, Xamarin allows you to build first class user experiences using the same native building blocks available via Objective-C and Java and share common code between platforms. Awesome, right?

              <p>JavaScript dependency loading is tricky business. The scripts have to be loaded in a particular order, they have to add global variables to communicate with each other, and they block they page's DOM while loading. Require.js is an AMD framework that helps take care of many of these issues. It's also easy to use in an MVC application with the proper setup. This session includes an introduction to require.js and how it can be utilized in an ASP.NET MVC application.</p>

              <p>Writing web services using the ASP.NET Web API can be quite satisfying. For SOAP developers accustomed to strict separations between bindings and contracts, it can also be a frustrating experience. Without proper foresight and planning, the boundaries between controller actions and the transport can get fuzzy, potentially leading to design complications as your application matures. In this code-focused session, you'll learn about one of the Web API's key extensibility mechanisms that can help to separate an application's "plumbing" from its business logic and data-handling concerns. When you've completed this session, you'll understand the Web API's object model and how to write global and per-route HTTP handlers to solve a range of cross-cutting problems.</p>

              <p><p>I have worked with and studied several top developers (e.g., leaders of an open source project with millions of downloads) as they write code. Both anecdotal and video evidence shows that these developers are fixing bugs 10-15X faster than others. Yet when analyzing these developers' performances it's not their superior brainpower that sets them apart, it's their workflow strategy. Instead of wasting time clicking around the Solution Explorer for a starting point they search for relevant files and get started instantly. Instead of haphazardly scrolling through open files they navigate the code by following its structure (e.g., references and calls), eliminating many costly distractions. Adopting this search-driven, structured workflow allows even more modest developers (like myself) to dramatically increase their productivity. </p><p>In this talk I'll focus on two things: providing evidence of the problem and offering practical advice on how to implement this approach in your own Visual Studio. To understand the problem we'll analyze videos of developers working on real bug tasks, listen to interviews with top developers, and even delve (briefly) into a few academic studies. To help implement this approach in your own workspace we'll download the appropriate tool support (e.g., the free, open source Sando extension), work through an example bug together on my machine, and finally I'll provide an example for you to try on your own laptop. By the end of this session you should be able to search and navigate code, and ultimately squash bugs, much more efficiently.</p></p>

But a new breed of application, the Single Page Application, has become popular, and the need to test client-side JavaScript (never a commonly tested language) is ever more urgent. Many frameworks have arisen to address this need. Commonly referred to as JavaScript MVC frameworks, they allow us to build ever larger applications in the browser. Angular JS is unique among these frameworks because it was built from the ground up to support automated testing. This talk will cover how to do test driven development with Angular JS.</p>

Martin Fowler calls this conundrum the "Tradable Quality Hypothesis."

              <p>HTML5 includes a Canvas element that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.  Using this, web developers can draw images directly in their web pages with JavaScript, enabling applications such as games, mapping, and data visualization to offload the rendering to the client.  One problem with the Canvas, though, is that the rendered image is just that: an image.  The user is unable to interact with any of the shapes that are drawn to the Canvas.  However, an open source library called Kinetic bridges that gap, allowing shapes or images to be drawn using the existing Canvas API, event listeners attached to them, and manipulated individually using mouse or touch (i.e., move, scale, and rotate).  This session will introduce how to use the Canvas API and Kinetic.js in a desktop or mobile web application.</p>

              <p><p>Knockout is a Javascript library that helps you use the MVVM pattern in writing web apps.  It provides 2-way data binding between properties in your code and objects in the DOM, decreasing the clutter in your code and saving you from the tedium of manually setting data on and retrieving data from the DOM</p><p>That's great, but will it really work for the crazy things that you need for your web app?  How far can you go with Knockout?  How much can it's data bindings really do?  Will it work with jQuery UI widgets?</p><p>Come to this session if you want to learn how to extend Knockout with custom Bindings and custom Extenders.</p><p>We'll start with a brief overview of how to use Knockout, and we'll review the standard Knockout Binders.  Then we'll dig into the Knockout source and see what a binder is made of, and we'll create one ourselves.  We'll also look at how to create a custom Knockout Extender, and how to know whether you need to create a Binder or an Extender.  And we'll wrap up by showing how to create a custom Knockout Binder for jQuery UI widgets.</p></p>

              <p><p>If you've ever been involved in promoting cultural changes within an organization, you may have experienced something even more disheartening than flat-out rejection: a full rollback of cultural change and a decade-long resentment of anyone remotely associated with the implementation. This has happened at countless organizations with agile, with SOA, with virtualization – and it's starting to happen with DevOps.</p><p>How can such as simple idea that's been so successful at so many companies become such a resounding failure at others? It's not the organization, and it's certainly not DevOps. The problem lies in the implementation, and ultimately, with its promoters and champions.</p><p>In this talk, I'll discuss both technical and organizational strategies for a successful long-term DevOps implementation, go over a few big failures at big companies, and cover the common and not-so-common pitfalls when promoting this type of cultural change.</p></p>

              <p><p>With Backbone, don't leave your jQuery plugins shivering out in the cold production air.  We can keep them warm and toasty in a coat of Backbone view goodness. Gone are the days when we just copy and paste plugin files and start hacking in our script tags. Now that we have the expressiveness and modularity of Backbone views to manage our application behavior we can build a reusable facade for jQuery plugins..  I'm going to provide a guide to wrapping our jQuery plugins cozily in Backbone views.</p><p>I'll be giving you an alternative to large spaghetti .render() methods that make every jQuery plugin initialization call. I'll walk you through the key tactics in decomposing a plugin into it's core functionality and explain how to flexibly build your backbone view. We will also discuss the best patterns and styles for wrapping different kinds of jQuery plugins.  Most notably, I'll be going through the process of wrapping jCarousel in a Backbone view that can be reused in many different situations.</p></p>

              <p>Triggers are extremely powerful and useful (if somewhat rarely needed) objects that are coded very similar to a common stored procedure. Yet for their similarity, there are some very important differences that need to be understood. In this session, I will walk through what goes into writing a robust DML trigger, starting with a simple version of a trigger, and working through some very useful applications of DML Triggers.</p>

The application discussed had 90 thousand lines of client-side JavaScript code, and was built on AMD and Backbone JS against a Java back end. An examination of the technical wins and losses, good ideas, bad ideas, and everything in between. We will cover code structure and organization, 3rd party development tools used, custom development tools built, development practices and methodologies used, and organizational structure, and how each of these items affected the cost of the project. We will also see important statistics and performance metrics of the project. The focus will be on disseminating wisdom for future projects of this size and bigger.</p>
