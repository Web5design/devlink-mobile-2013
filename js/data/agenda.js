    "description": "PowerShell is one of those tools that gets a lot of attention from the IT administration side, but many developers think it's not a tool aimed at them.  But trust me, PowerShell is an arrow that no developer's quiver should be without.  Using real-world examples, come learn how you can find problems in your source code, uncover production bugs in your application, tinker with .NET libraries without having to create throw-away projects, and simplify production application updates.  If you've never used PowerShell before, this is the session for you.  If you've used it once or twice but aren't sure how to use it to simplify your development life, this is the session for you.  Even if you're using PowerShell on a semi-regular basis, you may still learn a trick or two!"

    "speaker": "Kevin Hazzard",
    "description": "Using the ASP.NET Web API for callbacks on your client-facing web servers makes a lot of sense, especially if you're using Microsoft's MVC framework. But many developers are beginning to see the value in using the Web API in the middle tier, too. Reusing skills and code from the web in the development of core services is an alluring prospect. Making the leap from WCF to the Web API can be daunting, however, because the systems are quite different from one another. In this session, we'll compare the WCF object model and its conventions to the Web API, using code to draw comparisons between various features. When you've completed this session, you'll be \"Thinking in HTTP\" and ready to try the Web API to develop your application's core."

    "description": "In the beginning, we had static websites. Then we invented AJAX, and our websites became alive with dynamic content. Now we're getting to a point where we'd like to have our web applications work in cool asynchronous ways across all of it's connected users. The typically example would be a chat room. You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room. In the past, in order to build a system like that took time and code. How about dynamically refreshing content in your application based on events that happen on the server? SignalR is a library that assists you in building real-time, multi-user interactive web applications. In this talk, we'll discuss the current state of the real time web, and then WOW you with quick, easy, and code-filled demos showing off the power of SignalR."

That's easy enough if you are delivering one small web app, but what if your application is composed of several web apps across multiple tiers with a large database and maybe even a few Windows services and scheduled tasks? Now you need a deployment system that is built to scale and allows you to automate all of these tasks to achieve consistency in your deployments. In this talk i will show you how to deploy a complex application to multiple environments with just the click of a button using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy."

    "description": "One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent \"tree\" or a multi-parent \"graph\"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It also turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example: the relationship of actors to movies they have been in).  In this session, I will demonstrate several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy needs that you can put into practice immediately, with ready made T-SQL examples."

As a long time Ruby developer I learned how BDD helps create expressive specs that lead to high quality software. I've since learned how to harness these practices and apply them to .NET development. Over time I've concluded that writing better specs does more than boost my coverage stats or make my code \"safer\" -- it makes me a better developer.</p><p>This presentation will teach you how to use BDD as a tool for better design and more expressive code. You will gain a deep understanding of the MSpec famework and learn the technique of writing \"outcome first specs.\" You'll learn how to apply BDD to a variety of software projects. Most importantly, you'll learn how being expressive in testing leads to more informed design decisions and ultimately to better software.</p>"

SQL Server provides you with a number of tools to weave layers of defense to make sure that all stored data meets the base requirements set forth in the design.  In this session I will demonstrate how to implement data protection using PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK and NULL constraints, and when constraints are not enough, triggers.  Sometimes it may even be necessary to resort to stored procedures and client code for the primary data protection (and the ideal system will be so tight from the UI standpoint that these constraints are silent almost all of the time).  Examples will include versions of foreign key, data formatting,  range checks, value reasonableness, all using scenarios that go beyond simple mechanical examples of constraints."

For most developers, there's an tacit belief that the rest of JavaScript falls under “bad,” especially when comparing that to the 900 pages of “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide” There are websites dedicated to these list of language mis-features and anti-patterns, and dozens of blog posts about how to avoid the “bad” in your own code.</p><p>I don't think that these most of these things are actually “bad”. In their day to day, developers don't need to worry about all of these smaller issues. Chances are, a JavaScript developer has encountered these difficult issues, learned the solution, and then immediately absorbed the concepts.</p><p>I'm going to explain to you, the real “bad” parts of the language. These are at least three JavaScript language features that are the most likely to trip up a JavaScript developer. Once you innately understand these issues, you will become significantly more productive in JavaScript, and will be a lot less confused when reading through large JavaScript code bases.</p>"

    "description": "<p>jQuery has definitely become popular in the last several years. Unfortunately you might have found that organizing your application with jQuery can become difficult and you may experience code that feels more like a plate of spaghetti logic.</p><p>Thankfully several frameworks have been developed (Backbone.js and AngularJS) to help address these concerns and they provide a mechanism to loosely couple your components and encourage you to organize your code in a way that can increase maintainability.</p><p>In this session we will take a look at a tightly coupled jQuery application and slow convert it to both a Backbone.js application and an AngularJS application. During the conversion we will introduce the various components of each framework and discuss some pros and cons of each approach.</p><p>In addition to an overview of the two frameworks, we will cover some helpful resources that you can reference as you dive into them on your own.</p>"

The draw of independence, self-reliance, flexibility and agility, growth and profit potential are all very appealing to right kind of individual.  Indeed being a freelance consultant or part of a small company can prove to be extraordinarily rewarding.</p><p>However, to quote Peter Parker, \"with great power comes great responsibility.\"  If all you want to do is sit at a computer and write code all day, then professional independence is not for you.  You have to think about marketing and sales, accounting, billing, managing contractors or employees.  And not least of all, you must always be cognizant of the legal and tax implications of your actions and decisions.</p><p>This discussion is definitely NOT a replacement for seeking advice for your own qualified tax and legal advisors.  However, we will delve into some of the major issues facing owners of new small businesses.  This includes the choice of an appropriate business entity (e.g., sole proprietor, partnership, LLC); actual incorporation; asset protection for your business and your family; taxes (income and self-employment); and how to actually pay yourself.</p><p>If you are a small business owner -- or are seriously considering becoming one -- hopefully at the end of this session you will have a solid start to the questions that you need to ask yourself, and your accountant and lawyer, to make the best possible decisions for your situation.</p>"

When the data gathered does not fit within your applications' SLA, operations can digitally interact with development, creating a traceable conversation about what when wrong. Using technologies like IntelliTrace and Visual Studio 2012 with Team Foundation Server 2012, you'll see how developers can easily get to the root of an application problem and provide a fix all the while keeping Operations in the loop. In addition to seeing it work live, you will drill down into the technology and how it works, providing you with best practices for deployment and use in your own organization."

Whether it's an entire toolkit, a framework that meets some specific needs, or a simple custom control from NuGet, CodePlex, or CodeProject, it is hard to ignore the opportunity to improve our rate of development while learning new things from open source projects.</p><p>But what does “open source” truly mean?  Especially when working in a professional or corporate environment, what are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools. Often that depends upon the authors' own decisions regarding project licensing.</p><p>In this one-hour session, we will review a few of the core principals of open-source development and consumption, compare and contrast some of the more popular licenses in use today, and discuss both how to use the open source works of others and also how to properly license your own.</p>"

As a developer who may end up writing for the phone, tablet, web, and desktop, it can be critical to make the correct choices up front in terms of your team's development patterns and application architecture.</p><p>In this one-hour session, we will discuss some of the pitfalls faced by teams today.  Particularly for apps that are already in production, what limitations may there be to extending for the mobile and tablet world?  And if you are building from the ground up, what choices do you have to create a robust, flexible, accessible server and API that can be used by your own client app dev teams, as well as third-party API consumers who can extend your brand even further.</p><p>Our technical focus will largely remain agnostic to your chosen database technology, SQL (or NoSQL), and other back-end logic.  Instead, we will look at the services and client tiers.  The discussion will weigh the pros and cons of WCF Data Services (with JSON endpoints), as well as building RESTful services with the newer MVC 4 Web API.  Client-side technologies could be anything, but we will certainly consider at least clients for the web, iOS (via MonoTouch), and possibly XAML/WinJS for Windows 8.</p>"

There are several cross-platform frameworks based upon with web technologies, but this is the first mobile development product aimed squarely at C# developers. Beyond that, Xamarin allows you to build first class user experiences using the same native building blocks available via Objective-C and Java and share common code between platforms. Awesome, right? There's more. </p><p>In this session, I'll get you up to speed with Xamarin and share lessons learned while building apps with Xamarin at Firefly Logic.

    "description": "Writing web services using the ASP.NET Web API can be quite satisfying. For SOAP developers accustomed to strict separations between bindings and contracts, it can also be a frustrating experience. Without proper foresight and planning, the boundaries between controller actions and the transport can get fuzzy, potentially leading to design complications as your application matures. In this code-focused session, you'll learn about one of the Web API's key extensibility mechanisms that can help to separate an application's \"plumbing\" from its business logic and data-handling concerns. When you've completed this session, you'll understand the Web API's object model and how to write global and per-route HTTP handlers to solve a range of cross-cutting problems."

    "speaker": "David Shepherd",
    "description": "<p>I have worked with and studied several top developers (e.g., leaders of an open source project with millions of downloads) as they write code. Both anecdotal and video evidence shows that these developers are fixing bugs 10-15X faster than others. Yet when analyzing these developers' performances it's not their superior brainpower that sets them apart, it's their workflow strategy. Instead of wasting time clicking around the Solution Explorer for a starting point they search for relevant files and get started instantly. Instead of haphazardly scrolling through open files they navigate the code by following its structure (e.g., references and calls), eliminating many costly distractions. Adopting this search-driven, structured workflow allows even more modest developers (like myself) to dramatically increase their productivity. </p><p>In this talk I'll focus on two things: providing evidence of the problem and offering practical advice on how to implement this approach in your own Visual Studio. To understand the problem we'll analyze videos of developers working on real bug tasks, listen to interviews with top developers, and even delve (briefly) into a few academic studies. To help implement this approach in your own workspace we'll download the appropriate tool support (e.g., the free, open source Sando extension), work through an example bug together on my machine, and finally I'll provide an example for you to try on your own laptop. By the end of this session you should be able to search and navigate code, and ultimately squash bugs, much more efficiently.</p>"

    "description": "Test Driven Development is widely recognized as a proven method to improve both the quality and maintainability of code. But a new breed of application, the Single Page Application, has become popular, and the need to test client-side JavaScript (never a commonly tested language) is ever more urgent. Many frameworks have arisen to address this need. Commonly referred to as JavaScript MVC frameworks, they allow us to build ever larger applications in the browser. Angular JS is unique among these frameworks because it was built from the ground up to support automated testing. This talk will cover how to do test driven development with Angular JS."

    "speaker": "Jason Follas",
    "description": "HTML5 includes a Canvas element that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.  Using this, web developers can draw images directly in their web pages with JavaScript, enabling applications such as games, mapping, and data visualization to offload the rendering to the client.  One problem with the Canvas, though, is that the rendered image is just that: an image.  The user is unable to interact with any of the shapes that are drawn to the Canvas.  However, an open source library called Kinetic bridges that gap, allowing shapes or images to be drawn using the existing Canvas API, event listeners attached to them, and manipulated individually using mouse or touch (i.e., move, scale, and rotate).  This session will introduce how to use the Canvas API and Kinetic.js in a desktop or mobile web application."

It's not the organization, and it's certainly not DevOps. The problem lies in the implementation, and ultimately, with its promoters and champions.</p><p>In this talk, I'll discuss both technical and organizational strategies for a successful long-term DevOps implementation, go over a few big failures at big companies, and cover the common and not-so-common pitfalls when promoting this type of cultural change.</p>"
