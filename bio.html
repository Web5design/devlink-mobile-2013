    <h1>Brian Friesen</h1>
    <div style='background-position: -160px -80px;' class='speaker-image speaker-bio-image'></div>Brian Friesen has been pretending to be a developer for the last 6 years and lives in constant fear of being found out. As an occasional public speaker, he prefers to talk about things that are slightly out in left field. This explains why some people know him as "the regex guy" or "the monad guy". Seriously, who would choose those labels? Anyway, when he's not writing code, he's probably thinking about it, or, if he's sleeping, dreaming about it. In the rare case that no part of his mind is occupied by something vaguely code-related, he is probably playing with his kids or spending quality time with his wife near Detroit, where he has lived since 2012, when he took a job with the best company he has ever worked for, Quicken Loans. He is also a raging smart-alec.
