      <p>Lipscomb University’s School of Computing &amp; Informatics (SCI) offers graduate opportunities within IT domains critical to the tech industry. Our goal is to elevate the understanding and capabilities of the region's workforce within four specific areas: Health Care Informatics, Information Security, IT Management and Software Engineering. Our MS in Information Security (ISEC)program was designed to address an IT need in the community, specifically emphasizing the identification, prevention and mitigation of security concerns within an organization. The ISEC program was specifically designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to oversee and secure organizations' data and information. The SCI initiated an MS in IT Management (MITM) program in the Fall of 2012 to round our our professional graduate programs. Responding to calls from industry and the Nashville Technology Council, the MITM program was designed to equip students with the skills to create, plan, organize, lead, and control organizational IT. The program is unique by emphasizing the importance of data (9 hours) and allowing student selection of a specific area of emphasis (HCI, ISEC, and Organizational Leadership and Behavior). The MS in Software Engineering (MSSE) program is the most recent addition to SCI’s portfolio of graduate programs, going live in Fall 2013. This multidisciplinary program focuses on the most advanced practices, including the critical human factor in software development, testing, and validation for producing high quality, sophisticated and dependable software products.
