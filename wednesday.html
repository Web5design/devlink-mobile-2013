            <p>PowerShell is one of those tools that gets a lot of attention from the IT administration side, but many developers think it's not a tool aimed at them.  But trust me, PowerShell is an arrow that no developer's quiver should be without.  Using real-world examples, come learn how you can find problems in your source code, uncover production bugs in your application, tinker with .NET libraries without having to create throw-away projects, and simplify production application updates.  If you've never used PowerShell before, this is the session for you.  If you've used it once or twice but aren't sure how to use it to simplify your development life, this is the session for you.  Even if you're using PowerShell on a semi-regular basis, you may still learn a trick or two!</p>

            <p>Using the ASP.NET Web API for callbacks on your client-facing web servers makes a lot of sense, especially if you're using Microsoft's MVC framework. But many developers are beginning to see the value in using the Web API in the middle tier, too. Reusing skills and code from the web in the development of core services is an alluring prospect. Making the leap from WCF to the Web API can be daunting, however, because the systems are quite different from one another. In this session, we'll compare the WCF object model and its conventions to the Web API, using code to draw comparisons between various features. When you've completed this session, you'll be "Thinking in HTTP" and ready to try the Web API to develop your application's core.</p>

            <p>In the beginning, we had static websites. Then we invented AJAX, and our websites became alive with dynamic content. Now we're getting to a point where we'd like to have our web applications work in cool asynchronous ways across all of it's connected users. The typically example would be a chat room. You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room. In the past, in order to build a system like that took time and code. How about dynamically refreshing content in your application based on events that happen on the server? SignalR is a library that assists you in building real-time, multi-user interactive web applications. In this talk, we'll discuss the current state of the real time web, and then WOW you with quick, easy, and code-filled demos showing off the power of SignalR.</p>

            <p>One of the main tenets of Agile development is to deliver business value to the production environment early and often. That's easy enough if you are delivering one small web app, but what if your application is composed of several web apps across multiple tiers with a large database and maybe even a few Windows services and scheduled tasks? Now you need a deployment system that is built to scale and allows you to automate all of these tasks to achieve consistency in your deployments.

            <p>One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent "tree" or a multi-parent "graph"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It also turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example: the relationship of actors to movies they have been in).  In this session, I will demonstrate several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy needs that you can put into practice immediately, with ready made T-SQL examples.</p>

            <p><p>Behavior driven development has been around for a long time. With the help of Dave Chelimsky (RSpec) it's been fully embraced in the Ruby community. As a long time Ruby developer I learned how BDD helps create expressive specs that lead to high quality software. I've since learned how to harness these practices and apply them to .NET development. Over time I've concluded that writing better specs does more than boost my coverage stats or make my code "safer" -- it makes me a better developer.</p><p>This presentation will teach you how to use BDD as a tool for better design and more expressive code. You will gain a deep understanding of the MSpec famework and learn the technique of writing "outcome first specs." You'll learn how to apply BDD to a variety of software projects. Most importantly, you'll learn how being expressive in testing leads to more informed design decisions and ultimately to better software.</p></p>

            <p>jQuery provides a very productive environment for client side programming in JavaScript and is used by a majority of major web sites today.  It takes advantage of existing knowledge of CSS selector syntax to offer a powerful and efficient alternative to accessing elements.  The use of operation chaining and implicit iteration lead to a very compact and productive syntax.  The library is very lean at a mere 32K, yet provides a strong base and a great extensibility model which has led to a large number of plugin extensions to simplify web development.  The session will review how to use the library for very useful features while avoiding browser inconsistencies, and making AJAX calls to the server.  Several plug ins will be demonstrated which provide stunning client experiences with as little as 1 line of code!  Learn how jQuery greatly simplifies client side development.</p>

This has been an embraced paradigm on mobile for some time now, but what about the desktop? Version 2 of Packaged Apps brings access to native API's like the File System, Serial Communication, Networking, Identity and much more. As long as Chrome is installed, your application will run. Package your app once and reach any platform where Chrome is installed. It's not a web app, it's a packaged app. There are a few things that you need to know when building without a server. Certain patterns will serve you well and there are security implications to be aware of. Be prepared for packaged apps with this session and learn how to start building them today.</p>

            <p>In introductory artificial intelligence classes, we learn about ELIZA, a program which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist using pattern-matching techniques.  For example, a comment like "I hate my job" might get an answer like "Why do you hate your job?"  Eliza was famous for being one of the first programs to pass the Turing test, meaning that the dialogue was realistic enough that users assumed that it was a human and not a machine speaking back to them.  I will introduce these basic concepts and show an implementation of Eliza as a Windows Store app for Windows 8.</p>

            <p>The most important part of a database is the data and the best way to make sure the data is useful is make sure it has integrity.  SQL Server provides you with a number of tools to weave layers of defense to make sure that all stored data meets the base requirements set forth in the design.  In this session I will demonstrate how to implement data protection using PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK and NULL constraints, and when constraints are not enough, triggers.  Sometimes it may even be necessary to resort to stored procedures and client code for the primary data protection (and the ideal system will be so tight from the UI standpoint that these constraints are silent almost all of the time).  Examples will include versions of foreign key, data formatting,  range checks, value reasonableness, all using scenarios that go beyond simple mechanical examples of constraints.</p>

This session introduces .NET 4.5 Async and covers the topic in two different direction. First an overview of Async in .NET 4.5 is provided, showing how new API methods require its usage and how to properly call these methods. The second half of the presentation will focus on experienced developers and how this new model truly does simplify development for Async along all fronts by showing the "old way" and the "new way" side by side and highlighting the simplified error handling, process management and overall time to develop. After this session developers will have the tools needed to implement Async in their applications.</p>

            <p>Knockout.js is a powerful JavaScript library for binding your data and user interface elements together. Getting started with Knockout is easy, but as your application grows in complexity, it can be challenging to keep your code clean and performing optimally. Luckily, Knockout has a number of great extensibility points that you can leverage to build reusable solutions on top of Knockout. In this session, we will walk through a number of common problems and see how we can use these extensibility points to clean up our code, integrate with other libraries, and solve problems in an elegant way. We will dive into topics like custom bindings, observable extensions, binding providers, and custom template engines. Get ready for some code, as we work through these byte-sized problems live.</p>

            <p>Database Development got completely revamped with the release of SQL Server Data Tools. Visual Studio 2012 continues the enhancements. The former Visual Studio Database Projects have now been integrated into the all new SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). In this session we'll look at the tools included with SSDT such as the all new localdb, database snapshots, and the new way to publish your database. You'll also learn how to reverse engineer existing databases into your project, as well as how to do safe refactoring. Finally we'll not the limitations around the new SSDT and ways you can work around them. We'll also highlight differences between the new SSDT and the former Visual Studio Database Projects.</p>

            <p><p>During this session, attendees will be provided an overview of the requirements for using MonoGame (and .NET) to build a simple game and have it run on many platforms nearly 100% the same code base.   Demonstrations of this will be provided against both Mac and Windows platforms (including a Microsoft Surface and an iPad).</p><p>We will discuss benefits and limitations of this approach, best practices for getting started on the right track, and will leave attendees with information on additional resources for putting these concepts into practice with their own applications.</p><p>Most importantly, we will walk through a real, functioning application written in C# and show how multiple build configurations can be used to target many platforms.   Mac/iOS platforms will be targeted by MonoDevelop/MonoTouch while Windows platforms will be targeted with Visual Studio 2012 using Windows 8 pro.  The app demonstrated will not be a simple “Pong” clone and will be a full platformer with touch integration.</p></p>

            <p>Even though ASP.NET MVC is all the rage, many companies have large applications build on the tried-and-true WebForms platform. Fortunately, Microsoft has continued to evolve and improve WebForms including some nice additions in version 4.5. We'll discuss strongly typed data controls, model binding, HTML5 updates, as well as some improvements to the core ASP.NET framework available to both MVC and WebForms.</p>
